    "There are many different software packages for the visualisation and analysis of complex networks. Examples include `gephi`, `Cytoscape`, `pajek`, `NodeXL`, `cuttlefish`, `networkx` or `graph-tool`. In this course, we will be using `igraph`, an open-source software package for the modelling, analysis and visualisation of complex networks. It is not only widely-used in network analysis, it also has a rather simple interface, is available for all major operating systems and can be used from within a variety of programming languages, including `C/C++`, `R` and `python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the labs accompanying this course, we will cover the use of `igraph` from `python`, an easy-to-learn scripting language that is widely used in the development of web applications and for data analysis and visualisation tasks. The use of `igraph`'s `python` frontend will provide you with a good basis not only for the analysis of complex networks, but also for learning how to use `igraph` in other languages like `R`. If you are more familiar with programming in `C/C++` or `R`, you are welcome to use these languages to solve the labs. However sample solutions will be provided in `python` only, so if you use these languages you are on your own. That having said, the mapping of `python` solutions to the language of your choice should generally be straight-forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have already covered the basics of `python`, `ipython` and `igraph` in our initial tutorial, solving this lab should be straight-forward. But don't worry: future assignments will be a bit more tricky :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the tutorial, we first need to import a couple of packages and we should define a helper function that allows us to show networks directly in `ipython`. As such, from now on we will use the following standard preamble."
